# Albers

This was a school project to generate and display Albers colour illusion which is discussed in [his book](http://www.amazon.com/Interaction-Color-Revised-Josef-Albers/dp/0300018460).

I honestly can't remember all the details of the assignment this fulfilled, but better a readme saying that than nothing, huh?
